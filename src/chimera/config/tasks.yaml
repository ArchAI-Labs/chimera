    Create a CONCISE editorial strategy (not detailed content) for LinkedIn content.
    
    This should be a brief strategic document (200-300 words) that includes:
    - List of specific post topics/angles (one per post requested)
    - Target audience definition
    - Content mix strategy (educational vs promotional vs thought leadership)
    - Hashtag strategy (3-5 main hashtags)
    
    Keep it strategic and concise - just the plan, not the actual content.

    A brief strategic overview containing:
    1. {num_posts} specific post topics/angles listed
    2. Target audience profile (1-2 sentences)
    3. Content mix percentages
    4. Primary hashtag strategy
    
    Should be 200-300 words max.

posts_with_research:
  description: |
    Research current information AND write complete LinkedIn posts in one step.
    
    For each post angle from the editorial strategy:
    1. Research relevant, current information
       - Use web_search tool for technical/industry content
       - Use search_knowledge tool for product-specific content
       - Find statistics, trends, and insights
    
    2. Write a complete, ready-to-publish LinkedIn post
       - 1300-2000 characters
       - Scroll-stopping first line
       - Short paragraphs (1-2 lines each)
       - 1-2 strategic emojis
       - Clear call-to-action
       - 3-5 relevant hashtags
    
    3. Include a brief research note (1-2 sentences) citing key data used
    
    DO NOT create separate research documents - integrate research into posts.
    
  expected_output: |
    {num_posts} complete LinkedIn posts formatted as:
    
    === POST 1: [Title] ===
    [Complete post text]
    [hashtags]
    [Brief research note: key insights used]
    
    === POST 2: [Title] ===
    [Complete post text]
    [hashtags]

    (etc.)

visual_prompts:
  description: |
    Create ready-to-use DALL-E image generation prompts for each post.
    
    For each post, analyze the content and create a detailed DALL-E prompt that:
    - Describes exactly what should be shown in the image
    - Specifies the visual style (minimalist, professional, bold, etc.)
    - Includes color scheme recommendations
    - Ensures no text in images
    - Is professional and LinkedIn-appropriate
    - Can be used immediately without modification
    
    Focus on ACTIONABLE prompts, not vague concepts.
    
  expected_output: |
    One complete DALL-E prompt per post:
    
    === POST 1 DALLE PROMPT ===
    [Detailed, specific prompt ready for image generation]
    
    === POST 2 DALLE PROMPT ===
    [Detailed, specific prompt ready for image generation]
    
    (One prompt per post)

content_calendar:

    - Publishing date (calculate based on frequency)
    - Post title/theme (extract from posts)
    - Visual asset reference (which DALL-E prompt to use)
    - Optimal posting time for LinkedIn
    - Success metrics to track

    A markdown table format calendar with columns:
    | Post # | Date | Title | Visual | Time | Metrics |
