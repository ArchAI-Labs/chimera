editorial_plan:
  description: >
     You MUST NOT delegate to both experts in the same run. If unsure, ask yourself one clarification and choose one.
      Use at most one "Delegate work to coworker" during the research stage; no parallel delegations.

      When the expert is "generalista", coordinate the creation of a strategic editorial plan about {topic}.
      The manager should then organize the findings into a balanced editorial plan with {num_posts} {frequency} LinkedIn posts.

      If "generalista", follow these Guidelines:
      - Each post must clearly specify its content type and its target audience.
      - Maintain a balance: ~50% primary audience, ~40% secondary, max 10% tertiary.
      - Titles must be impactful and short.
      - Descriptions must use concrete examples, data, or references (no generic claims).

     When the expert is "prodotto", coordinate the creation of a strategic editorial plan about {topic} without considering the generalist expert.
      The manager should then organize the findings into a balanced editorial plan with {num_posts} {frequency} LinkedIn posts.
      When {expert_type} is selected, do not delegate the same task to the other expert.
