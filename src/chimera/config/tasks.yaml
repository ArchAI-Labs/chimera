    Take the LinkedIn posts that have been created and plan them into a {frequency} schedule.

    **Guidelines:**
    - Use exactly {num_posts} rows in the table (no more, no less).
    - Do not repeat post titles, days, or times.
    - If {frequency} is "settimanali", distribute posts across weekdays (avoid weekends if possible).
    - If {frequency} is "mensili", distribute posts evenly across different weeks of the month.
    - If {frequency} is another type, adapt the schedule logically (e.g., bi-weekly → one post every 2 weeks).
    - Include the responsible team member (default: "Roberto") in the table.
    - Output only the final table without extra explanations or repeated sections.

  expected_output: >
    A Markdown table named "LinkedIn Content Calendar - {topic}" with the following columns:
    | Period ({frequency}) | Day | Time | Title | Responsible |
